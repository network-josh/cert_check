This is my attempt to make some certificate work I find myself doing simplier.

I hope to use this set of tools to help request, verify, and do other needful things with certificates and eventually see if I can figure out how to integrate directly with various network vendors (F5, Palo Alto, Cisco, etc) to validate against items there and even push the certificates
